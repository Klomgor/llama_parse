## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 22 or higher)
- pnpm package manager
- LlamaCloud API key

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/run-llama/llama_cloud_services
cd lama_cloud_services/examples-ts/classify/
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up your environment variables:

```bash
# Add your API key to your environment
export LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY="your-llamacloud-api-key"
```

## Usage

### Start the Demo

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be up and running on http://localhost:3000

## How It Works

1. **Document Input**: Enter the path to your document when prompted
2. **Parsing**: LlamaClassify, based on the rules you can find [here](./src/utils/classifier.ts), processes the document and classifies it
3. **Results**: The classification outcome, as well as the reasoning behind it and the confidence score, are displayed in the UI.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Module Resolution Errors**: Ensure you're using Node.js 22+ and have all dependencies installed
2. **API Key Issues**: Verify your LlamaCloud API key is correctly set
3. **File Path Errors**: Use absolute paths or ensure relative paths are correct from the project root
